### Widgets
*This folder contains a variety of graphical user interface (GUI) tools built using the Tkinter widget toolkit.*

> 1. **Calculator.py:** A GUI for Calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
> 1. **Clock.py:** A digital clock GUI.
> 1. **FileSearch.py:** This is a file searching utility that allows a user to search for files in a specific directory that match a given search string. The utility has a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter widget toolkit.
> 1. **ImageEditor.py:** A GUI for Image editing, with features like: Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, Colour, and cropping.

> 1. **ToDoList.py:** This is a simple to-do list application that allows a user to create a list of tasks and mark them as complete when they are finished.

### FileUtilities
*This folder contains a collection of custom-developed tools. Each script includes a description of the problem it was designed to solve.*

> 1. **DirComparator.py:** This script compares the files in the two directories (and their subdirectories) and returns a list of dictionaries, each containing the file path and reason for the difference (either 'only in dir1', 'only in dir2', or 'content differs').
> 1. **DirReporter.py:** This script generates a report of all the files in a given directory. The report can be in either HTML or CSV format. The app iterates through all the files in the directory, collects the file name, size, and last modified date for each file, and adds this data to a list.
> 1. **ExtensionChanger.py:** This script converts files from one format to another. It takes in an input folder, an output folder, and the input and output formats as arguments.
> 1. **FileExtractor.py:** This script moves files with a specified file extension from a source directory to a destination directory.
> 1. **MeasureExecution.py:** Measures the execution time of a program.
> 1. **Renamer.py:** This script renames all the files in a given directory according to a specified pattern.
> 1. **SearchString.py:** A utility that searches for a specific string of text within a set of files and returns the results in a structured format.
> 1. **SizeSplitter.py:** A tool that splits a large file into smaller chunks for easier handling. This could be useful for transferring large files over a network or for dividing a file for parallel processing.
> 1. **Zipper.py:** This script creates a zip file for each subdirectory in a given source directory.
